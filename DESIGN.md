# Stormtide Design
Designing a rules engine for *Magic* is a difficult and daunting task. This document will try to lay out some of plans for the simplest possible rules engine implementation that can handle the entirety of the game's black-bordered cards.

For the time being, the most current documentation lives in the code comments. See [src/game.rs](src/game.rs) for a good starting point.
