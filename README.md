# Stormtide Corrosion
This is an attempt to implement a Magic rules engine in Rust.

This repository just contains the core rules engine and a small program to bootstrap tests. It won't contain a UI

## Goals
* Clean, readability-focused codebase
* High rules accuracy and coverage
* Deterministic game replays
* High performance, but zero crashes

## Future Plans
* Actually have a reasonable subset of the game
* Compile to WASM, build a browser UI
